# Retail trade area analysis by Team-27

 Retail Trade Area Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept for a retail trade area analysis for a supermarket based in Cape Town. The analysis was conducted using the following tools:

Python
Streamlit
Geopandas
The analysis was conducted to determine where to place a supermarket in Cape Town. The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

Collect data on the location of all supermarkets in Cape Town.
Estimate the travel time between each supermarket and every point in Cape Town, taking into account population density, taxi and travel routes data.
Define the trade area of each supermarket as the area within a certain travel time.
Analyze the trade areas of the supermarkets to identify areas with high competition and areas with potential for new supermarkets.
. However, there are some areas with high competition, such as the city center and the suburbs of Sea Point and Green Point. There are also some areas with potential for new supermarkets

The analysis was conducted during an internship at Explore AI.
